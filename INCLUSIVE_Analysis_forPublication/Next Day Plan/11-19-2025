November 19, 2025 Todo List

Do the 4 readings and be able to summarize the flux constraint
answer these questions:
	1.	What exactly is the flux constraint doing?
	2.	How do we apply it?
	3.	What are the differences across the four approaches?

Plot Deliverable
--> ME Unordered universes: nue constraint (red histogram), no nue constraint (black histogram) with mean & RMS
--> LE universes (the 100 that we have): nue constraint (black histogram), ME nue constraint applied to
                                         LE universes (red histogram)
Total: 8 plots
	•	differences between ME vs LE
	•	appearance of constraints
	•	RMS structure
	•	any unexpected behaviour
	•	next step or question for yourself or supervisor
