November 3, 2025
--> Devised the plan for the studies to run for the blowup problem

November 5, 2025
--> Submitted all the jobs to the grid: yes lownu, no lownu for yes remove electron neutrinos, no don't remove
    electron neutrinos, for MAD ME1A, MAD ME6A, CCQENu ME1A for all three variations of the muon curvature sig cut


November 7, 2025
--> The jobs from earlier just showed that skipping over the electron neutrino events didn't make a difference on the muon
    systematics plot, so we can just not run over that option anymore
--> But we need to run over the options again, this time put in LE for no lownu flux param. and also, for faster running
    just keep the muon reconstruction systematic error band turned on

November 15, 2025
--> The root files were moved over to /exp/minerva/data/

November 18, 2025
--> Ran all the playlists with all the systematics turned on 
--> Efficiency 1M is still the one running, needed to add that into the combined eff file and extract xsec
    again
--> Ran over all stats and 10 iterations and the blowup problem is showing up for every mode basically

Crazy Discovery: Antineutrino LE 
--> From the other day when we ran with only the muon systematics, unfolding that with 10 iterations still yields no blowup
    for antineutrino LE
    --> no blowup with 3 iterations, but breakdown still doesn't match 3 iterations breakdown plot from earlier
--> Howeover, now when I ran with all the systematics (that was the only intended difference) there is no blowup with
    3 iterations, and no blowup with 10 iterations either

Summary of Problem
Here’s 2 runs of what should’ve been the same thing:
NO BLOWUP: /exp/minerva/data/users/mmehmood/default_anaysis_loc/Nov14/MAD_minerva5_Sample2_SemiCurv/xsec_notBinWidthNorm_10iter.root
YES BLOWUP: /pnfs/minerva/persistent/users/mmehmood/default_analysis_loc/LE_antinuRHC_Sample2_SemiCurv/xsec_notBinWidthNorm.root

The only intended difference was that the run yielding Yes blowup was done to just repeat with all systematics 
since the other one only has the muon systematics
