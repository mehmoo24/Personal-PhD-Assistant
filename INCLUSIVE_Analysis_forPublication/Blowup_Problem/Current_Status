--> Devised the plan for the studies to run for the blowup problem

November 5, 2025
--> Submitted all the jobs to the grid: yes lownu, no lownu for yes remove electron neutrinos, no don't remove
    electron neutrinos, for MAD ME1A, MAD ME6A, CCQENu ME1A for all three variations of the muon curvature sig cut


November 7, 2025
--> The jobs from earlier just showed that skipping over the electron neutrino events didn't make a difference on the muon
    systematics plot, so we can just not run over that option anymore
--> But we need to run over the options again, this time put in LE for no lownu flux param. and also, for faster running
    just keep the muon reconstruction systematic error band turned on

November 15, 2025
--> The root files were moved over to /exp/minerva/data/
