For the ME model comparisons --> We need to do the lownu flux parameterization

For the LE model comparisons --> Somehow the LE flux we're passing into the nuisance flux generator is not
the same as the flux we're using?

There's going to be 6 + 1 (MnvTune v1) Model Comparisons for all of them
--> NuWro LFG, SF
--> NEUT LFG, SF
--> GENIE 10a, AR23

--> For MnvTune v1 can have the breakdown with the different parts of the tune

That's 6 x 4 = 24 model predictions
--> I need this to work with the lownu flux parameterization
--> I need this to work with the flux that I'm actually using (in LE and in ME)

--> Since we're generating them again, we could just put in the lownu flux parameterization this time, 
    instead of reweighting it afterwards

--> I need the correct LE flux and the correct ME flux to pass into the nuisance event generator

I created the file /exp/minerva/app/users/mmehmood/MAT_AL9/GitRepo-Analysis/ana/ModelComparisons/NUISANCE_TUTORIAL/GetFRW_Flux/ME/FRW_flux_ME.root 
and that contains the lownu flux param. 
also the flux is per 0.5 GeV and per 10^6 POT since that's the LE flux already in the tutorial was in
