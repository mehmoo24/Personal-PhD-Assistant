The MINERvA LE flux in the tutorial has 201 bins
--> The MINERvA LE flux in FRW has only 39 bins --> can't rebin it so that we get more bins

The MINERvA ME flux from Dan also has 201 bins (in 500 MeV bins)
--> but the antineutrino version has 1001 bins, need to rebin it so that we end up with 201 bins
