--> There's 4 LE predictions still required (using the LE flux from teh tutorial b/c FRW has only 39 bins
    and can't turn that into more bins, tutorial LE flux has 201 or so bins)

--> Need to generate the appropriate binned flux for ME (have neutrino reference from Dan), apply lownu flux
    param. to that flux and then can regenerate the 12 model predictions 
    --> can compare what I get with what I had from before

--> As far as processing the flat trees is concerned, need to use the same binning to generate the 
    predictions as the one that I'm using now


2026-02-13
--> Submitted all 12 LE model comparisons to the grid again, using the LE flux from the tutorial
--> running on gpvm05, gpvm06, gpvm07


Moved the image to /pnfs/minerva/persistent/users/mmehmood/image/nuisance_nuint2024.sif since it was really big
--> Want to run the model comparisons on the grid. Need to ensure that the size of the directory is small
