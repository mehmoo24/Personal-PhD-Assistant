--> There's 4 LE predictions still required (using the LE flux from teh tutorial b/c FRW has only 39 bins
    and can't turn that into more bins, tutorial LE flux has 201 or so bins)

--> Need to generate the appropriate binned flux for ME (have neutrino reference from Dan), apply lownu flux
    param. to that flux and then can regenerate the 12 model predictions 
    --> can compare what I get with what I had from before

--> As far as processing the flat trees is concerned, need to use the same binning to generate the 
    predictions as the one that I'm using now

--> Submitted all 12 LE model comparisons to the grid again, using the LE flux from the tutorial
--> running on gpvm05, gpvm06, gpvm07


Moved the image to /pnfs/minerva/persistent/users/mmehmood/image/nuisance_nuint2024.sif since it was really big
--> Want to run the model comparisons on the grid. Need to ensure that the size of the directory is small

The LE predictions with the 100 disk size should now be correct and only the processFlattrees need to be run on them
--> small caveat to do the closure test for LE and match the flux
The ME predictions are turning up empty root files. likely the problem is that the error in the ME flux files which have
been rebinned as well as the lownu flux param. applied to them have an error of 0. this was because for the rebinning
went from a fewer number of bins to a larger number and some of the bins came from 2 bins (like the 0.5 GeV bin had content
coming in from 2 of the original histogram bins, so for the error need to do a proper correlation and so should look into 
that)
