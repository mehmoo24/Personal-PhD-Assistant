--> There's 4 LE predictions still required (using the LE flux from teh tutorial b/c FRW has only 39 bins
    and can't turn that into more bins, tutorial LE flux has 201 or so bins)

--> Need to generate the appropriate binned flux for ME (have neutrino reference from Dan), apply lownu flux
    param. to that flux and then can regenerate the 12 model predictions 
    --> can compare what I get with what I had from before
