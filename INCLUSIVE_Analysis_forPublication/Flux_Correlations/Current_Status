--> Made plots of the different correlations
--> Observed: no correlation between ME and LE fluxes, that is likely due to the ordering of the flux universes being diff

--> the LE flux universes are currently 100, don't know if 1000 ever generated? asked on slack
--> the ME flux universes are 1000 but have been re-ordered

November 5, 2025
ME and LE Flux landscape scan
--> According to Rob Fine, flux slack channel, MINERvA chat: Jaewon was working with 1000 LE flux
    universes for the nu-e constraint analysis, looks like he had flux weights for all those
    universes baked directly into his analysis ntuples
    --> Rob thinks Jaewon's work predated a standard tool to pull the flux weights at analysis time
        --> It's possible that when FRW was developed his code was used, but for whatever reason the norm of using
            only 100 flux universes was established?
    --> Don't know if we have the same 1000 universes for ME and for LE (Rob doesn't remember investigating, 
    though the question came up when he was writing his thesis)
--> Laura email, October 27, 2025: says PPFX makes central value weights for each event during anatuple 
    production
    --> 1000 hadron production universe weights are also made using PPFX
    --> 1000 (?) flux focusing weights also made
    --> After anatuple production, a script is run that constructs a central value flux for each neutrino flavour and
        configuration + 1000 combined uncertainty universes (obtained by multipying the hadron production and focusing wgts)
    --> NuE scattering + IMD weights constructed for each of the combined flux universes (Laura not sure if this is anatuple 
        production or flux histograms)
    --> Another script reorders the universes from 2 steps ago according to the size of the NuE scattering + IMD wgts
    --> The reordered flux MnvH1Ds + reordered NuE scattering weights are used by FluxReweighter to provide CV and flux 
        universe weights to analyzers
        --> At this point, weights are only a function of neutrino energy, not the entire neutrino flux ancestry

TODO List:
--> make the ME plots with 1000 universes ordered, NuE constraint turned on, NuE constraint turned off
--> make the ME plots with 1000 universes unordered, NuE constraint turned on, NuE constraint turned off
--> make a plot with the 100 LE universes and the first 100 from the unordered first 100 ME universes

--> Find and look  into Jaewon Park's thesis to see if I can pull up the 1000 universes that he had, though
    his anatuples were different? Rob makes a comment at being able to access it: Here's the code where the 
    distributions in fig 8 of the paper are produced, I think: https://cdcvs-el9-prod.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/public-cvs/cvsweb-public.cgi/AnalysisFramework/A[…]E/ana/make_hists/NuEHists_nue_wgt.cxx?cvsroot=mnvsoft;f=h (revision 1.10 looks to be the version contemporaneous with the LE paper)
--> Find and look into this paper that's being mentioned

--> What's the standard tool that Rob mentions which can pull the flux weights at analysis time? I think David'
    question in the email thread will potentially answer this. I ask because if the flux weights are produced
    at AnaTuple production level then this tool is using the Anatuples that we ran on to pull the flux weights? 
    But how does the tool know which AnaTuples we ran on?
--> determine where the LE universese are, if ever there were 1000 RESOLVED (answer above)
