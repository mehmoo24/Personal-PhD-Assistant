--> Made plots of the different correlations
--> Observed: no correlation between ME and LE fluxes, that is likely due to the ordering of the flux universes being diff

--> the LE flux universes are currently 100, don't know if 1000 ever generated? asked on slack
--> the ME flux universes are 1000 but have been re-ordered


TODO List:
--> make the ME plots with 1000 universes
--> see if can make the ME plots with the unordered 1000 universes?
--> determine where the LE universese are, if ever there were 1000
