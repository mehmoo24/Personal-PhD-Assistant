--> Made plots of the different correlations
--> Observed: no correlation between ME and LE fluxes, that is likely due to the ordering of the flux universes being diff

--> the LE flux universes are currently 100, don't know if 1000 ever generated? asked on slack
--> the ME flux universes are 1000 but have been re-ordered

--> ME and LE Flux landscape scan
--> According to Rob Fine, flux slack channel, MINERvA chat: Jaewon was working with 1000 LE flux
    universes for the nu-e constraint analysis, looks like he had flux weights for all those
    universes baked directly into his analysis ntuples
    --> Rob thinks Jaewon's work predated a standard tool to pull the flux weights at analysis time
        --> It's possible that when FRW was developed his code was used, but for whatever reason the norm of using
            only 100 flux universes was established?
--> Don't know if we have the same 1000 universes for ME and for LE (Rob doesn't remember investigating, 
    though the question came up when he was writing his thesis)
--> Laura email, October 27, 2025: says PPFX makes central value weights for each event during anatuple 
    production
--> 1000 hadron production universe weights are also made using PPFX
--> 
--> NuE scattering + IMD weights constructed for each universe (Laura not sure if this is 
    anatuple production or flux histograms)

TODO List:
--> make the ME plots with 1000 universes ordered
--> make the ME plots with 1000 universes unordered
--> make a plot with the 100 LE universes and the first 100 from the unordered first 100 ME universes

--> What's the standard tool that Rob mentions which can pull the flux weights at analysis time? I think David'
    question in the email thread will potentially answer this. I ask because if the flux weights are produced
    at AnaTuple production level then this tool is using the Anatuples that we ran on to pull the flux weights? 
    But how does the tool know which AnaTuples we ran on?
--> determine where the LE universese are, if ever there were 1000 RESOLVED (answer above)
