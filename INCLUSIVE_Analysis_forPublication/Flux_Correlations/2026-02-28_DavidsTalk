David's collab meeting talk
Luis Clarification

--> uses the covariance matrix
--> focusing uncertanties fully correlated --> one universe has a prediction for FHC and RHC
--> doesn't have freedom to chase differences in focusing FHC/RHC

--> the focusing unceratainties can't pull the falling edge up enough

--> should be careful about making the non focused flavours flux files
