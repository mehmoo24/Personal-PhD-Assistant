Always clone when writing a histogram from a file into another file. This is because if you write the histogram
to another file and then close the first file, it causes a crash since the histogram is still associated with the 
first file. Therefore, always clone it and write it to the second file so that if you close the first file, nothing 
happens. 

TLDR:
-> Always .Clone() histograms before writing thme to another file or closing the source file
-> Don't write a histogram to a different file unless it has been cloned

Can also just clone the histograms when read them in:
num_hist = f_num.Get("eff_num").Clone("eff_num_cloned")
num_hist.SetDirectory(0)

Also, always .Close() the output file that we created (don't close the other ones if there's multiple ones, 
since sometimes the object doesn't detach from the file and then there's trouble accessing it if the file
has been closed due to how the memory and the time the file is open are related ...)
