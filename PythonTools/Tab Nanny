compute_flux.py 222 '        print("Check1")\n'

tabnanny is telling you exactly what I suspected: line 222 has mixed indentation.

If you don’t want to chase this line-by-line:
expand -t 4 compute_flux.py > compute_flux_fixed.py
mv compute_flux_fixed.py compute_flux.py

This replaces all tabs with 4 spaces across the entire file — after that, tabnanny will stop complaining.
