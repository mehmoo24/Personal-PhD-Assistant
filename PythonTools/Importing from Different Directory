If the module you are importing is in a different directory, you need to add that directory to the python path
You also need to make sure that there is a __init__.py in that directory (could even just be empty)

export PYTHONPATH=/exp/minerva/app/users/mmehmood/MAT_AL9/GitRepo-Analysis/ana/BlowupProblem:$PYTHONPATH
