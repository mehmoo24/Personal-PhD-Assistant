 # Detach histograms from any TFile so they are not deleted
    histo_CV_flat.SetDirectory(0)
    histo_univ0_flat.SetDirectory(0)
    histo_univ1_flat.SetDirectory(0)

ALSO, don't modify original histograms, always Clone() them first if going to do something that changes the original histogram

Then, need to do .SetDirectory(0) on the clone to detach it from the TFile. SetDirectory(0) just makes sure whichever histo 
it is being called on, whether a clone or not, is not attached to any TFile, so that it doesn't accidentally get deleted
by closing the TFile or by ROOT accidentally deleting it
