For generating the model predictions, I wrote the LE flux with the stat error to a root file to pass into the container

--> I changed the flux histogram name and the PDG for running in neutrino mode vs antineutrino mode

Checklist for changing cards:
1. Change flux file
2. Change flux histo name
3. Change PDG
4. Change the options for which model to use
5. Change the number of events running over
6. Change name of output file
7. Change name of input card being read in (if there is an input card, like for NuWro)

ChatGPT:
Use one of NuWro’s SF switches and turn off RPA (RPA is a long-range correlation correction designed for FG/LFG; 
you generally don’t stack it on SF):
# --- QE model choices ---
sf_method = 1      # 1 = grid SF (Benhar tables)  (use 2 = factorized SF if you prefer)
qel_rpa   = 0      # RPA off when using SF

You’re seeing “LFG RPA” because your card has
sf_method = 0     # <- OFF
qel_rpa   = 1     # <- RPA ON (applies to the LFG QE model)
