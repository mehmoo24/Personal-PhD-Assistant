For generating the model predictions, I wrote the LE flux with the stat error to a root file to pass into the container

--> I changed the flux histogram name and the PDG for running in neutrino mode vs antineutrino mode

Checklist for changing cards:
1. Change flux file
2. Change flux histo name
3. Change PDG
4. Change the options for which model to use
5. Change the number of events running over
6. Change name of output file
7. Change name of input card being read in (if there is an input card, like for NuWro)
