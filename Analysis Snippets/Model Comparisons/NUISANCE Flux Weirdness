* The LE Flux file in NUISANCE doesn't match what I get when I plot out the LE FRW flux
--> I scaled the FRW by: 
frw_flux.Scale(1e+6)
frw_flux.Scale(0.5)
Instead then I scaled the NUISANCE flux by 
root [4] numu_fhc->Scale(2e-6)
so that it would be per POT and per GeV (it's per 0.5 GeV since that's the uniform binning it uses, the FRW flux
                                        uses non-uniform binning)

* The errors are not matching up either, I think the FRW is not using stats only, which is what Anezka said to use

* For the meantime, I'm using the FRW flux with the stat error and feeding that into the NUISANCE tutorial
FOLLOW UP: Does it matter if we feed it in per 10^6 POT or per POT and per GeV or per 0.5 GeV?
FOLLOW UP: The FRW flux is labelled per GeV but is it really that since the binning is finer than per GeV?
