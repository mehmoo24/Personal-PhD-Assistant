October 18
--> Changed the file to be using the minerva LE root file
--> re-running antineutrino LE LFG NUWRO
--> re-running neutrino LE LFG NUWRO

--> make sure to change up the root file to be using the minerva LE root file when run the rest
    of the model predictions

--> For the nuFHC LE, I used the predictions that Dan created, need to generate them again with the 
    FRW flux 
    --> need to change the flux file being read in ..?

TODO
--> for the LE model predictions, need to generate them again because this time was using the 
    minerva_le root file, need to generate them again with the FRW LE flux prediction but with 
    the normalization units matching what is in the minerva_le root file, I think that should work

--> need to generate the neutrino LE predictions because just used Dan's predictions so far
--> need to generate the AR23 prediction to the plots by generating it
