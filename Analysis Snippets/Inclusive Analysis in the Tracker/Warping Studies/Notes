-> The warping study smoothes out statistical fluctuations 
-> For low statistical samples (ex. LE antineutrinos), the sample is well-behaved  and so we need fewer iterations
-> This can be understood because the chi2 has the statistical uncertainty in the denominator and so a higher statistical uncertainty 
means that the chi2 is smaller

FHC LE Warping Study
-> Existing Problem: The number of iterations is too large and so the proposed solution was to find warps that are closer 
to the data/mc discrepancy
-> Look at data/mc discrepancy, see how discrepant the most discrepant bins are, scale the ratio of the warp to Mnvtunev1 so 
that the most discrepant bin is only that much off

Plan of Action
-> Get the FHC LE Data/MC Discrepancy plot for the cross section with 1 iteration
-> Get the plots for the 3 warps: lowQ2PionSuppressionTuneON, NonResOFF, RPAOFF
->
