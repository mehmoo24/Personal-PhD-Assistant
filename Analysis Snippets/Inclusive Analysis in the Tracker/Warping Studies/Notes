-> The warping study smoothes out statistical fluctuations 
-> For low statistical samples (ex. LE antineutrinos), the sample is well-behaved  and so we need fewer iterations
-> This can be understood because the chi2 has the statistical uncertainty in the denominator and so a higher statistical uncertainty 
means that the chi2 is smaller

FHC LE Warping Study
-> Existing Problem: The number of iterations is too large and so the proposed solution was to find warps that are closer 
to the data/mc discrepancy
-> Look at data/mc discrepancy, see how discrepant the most discrepant bins are, scale the ratio of the warp to Mnvtunev1 so 
that the most discrepant bin is only that much off

Plan of Action
-> Get the FHC LE Data/MC Discrepancy plot for the cross section with 1 iteration
-> Get the plots for the 3 warps: lowQ2PionSuppressionTuneON, NonResOFF, RPAOFF
-> Get the ratio for the warped EffNum / original EffNum, if that ratio is not between 0.77 and 1.23
(correspond to largest data/mc discrepancy) then change the warped EffNum and the warped signal events (which 
need to be unfolded to give the warped efficiency numerator) change both those distributions to be 0.77 * original EffNum
and 0.77 * original signal Events or 1.23 times both, whichever is closer to the existing ratio
