Quinn has the electron flux files here: 
/exp/minerva/app/users/qvuong/MAT_AL9/CC-NuE-XSec/flux_studies/

Quinn verbatim:
Anw you can find the fluxes here: /exp/minerva/app/users/qvuong/MAT_AL9/CC-NuE-XSec/flux_studies/
The ones I generated are messy because I was diagnosing, but basically the KEY: PlotUtils::MnvH1D	flux_E_cvweighted should 
give you the same flux as the existing one. The flux systematics are also in there. Because 
these are generated from analysis tuples which only contain 100 flux universes, the output fluxes can 
only have that many universes.

She has:
le1_e.root
le1_ebar.root
le5_ebar.root
MISSING: le5_e.root

PATHS: 
/exp/minerva/app/users/qvuong/MAT_AL9/CC-NuE-XSec/flux_studies/le1_ebar.root
/exp/minerva/app/users/qvuong/MAT_AL9/CC-NuE-XSec/flux_studies/le1_e.root
/exp/minerva/app/users/qvuong/MAT_AL9/CC-NuE-XSec/flux_studies/le5_ebar.root

Now, I need to modify my function, so that for reading in the electron flux, it uses these flux files


INSTEAD WHAT I'M DOING: 
FOR THE CASE OF ELECTRON NEUTRINOS, JUST USE A WEIGHT OF 1 FOR THE FLUX
