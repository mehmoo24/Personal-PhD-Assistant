-> Total Error plot problem fixed
-> Binning mapping determined
-> Generated all the plots for the different modes

TODO: 

--> Look through the plots and I'm thinking have data and MC on the same slide and background subtraction on first slide, 
unfolded distributions on next slide
--> Do that for all 7 systematics
--> Do that for all 4 modes (can put the other three modes in the backup)

--> Insert the updated iteration plots that I already made today
--> Insert the total fractional error plots for all 4 modes on the slides
--> Create the summary tables --> for the MC and for the data, which systematics need to become one-sided?
--> Match that up with in the data, which systematics do we need to make one sided for the blowup to disappear, earlier were
    seeing a discrepancy with that (BeamAngleX)
--> Do need to make and insert the total error plot* (could simply do it interactively as well)

(Task for after tomorrow, carry to next days:)
--> Need to run the one-sided shift code for the combined playlist, don't know why that wasn't working earlier

--> Add in explanation for the systematics

--> IMPORTANT: Go through Notes from Meeting with Deborah to see if anything else that needs to be added
