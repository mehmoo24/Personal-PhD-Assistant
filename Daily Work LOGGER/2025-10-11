Block #1:

1. Figuring out LE flux files to use for electron neutrinos
--> Quinn's files have the flux + 100 systematic flux universes
--> Me: Just using a weight of 1

2. run1.sh and run3.sh being run again

3. running neutrino LE and antineutrino LE predictions again for closure test with binning that matches 
   what I have for the flux
