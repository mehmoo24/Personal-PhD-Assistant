Deep Work Session 1: Continued Working on LE Closure Test
--> Remade the distributions that plot the FRW Flux and the GENIEXSecExtracto flux side by side since the binnning is diff
    (Plotting the 2 area normalized side by side)
--> The shapes of the flux distributions seem to be consistent with each other
--> I think putting back in the 2p2h events fixes this problem?
    --> But 2p2h events not in the ME xsec spline (weren't even there for the daisy reweighting procedure)
--> Only smoking gun left after this is the POT in the normalization

TODO: --> Put back in the 2p2h events for the genie LE xsec spline in GENIEXSecExtractor, also currently the GENIEXSecExtractor
          is running in LE mode w/ the
