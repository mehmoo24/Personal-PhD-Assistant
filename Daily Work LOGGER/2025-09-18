Deep Work #1:
--> Recap on notes from yesterday, do the KEY POINTS todo items from yesterday
--> Flat line problem from yesterday confirmed fixed, changed GENIEXSecExtractor, figuring out how to stash changes and switch 
    to other branch

Deep Work #2:
--> Work on the LE Closure Test:
    --> Figure out if the POT count for the skipped file is causing the problem
    --> Determine if the flux integral bounds are what are causing the problem
    --> Look at Amy's closure test?
    --> 

KEY POINTS:
--> Look at the files that I submitted to look at how many electron events are in the LE sample ...
--> Notes from meeting with Deborah
--> For the data bkg subtraction, need to have the electron neutrino flux files ... (can also use wgt of 1? compare and
    see what I get if I use Quinn's existing flux instead --> also look at the systematics on that front)
--> Email Rik about which model predictions to use/include 


Questions to Probe
--> Valenic flux and IMD? 
--> Systematic uncertainties coming from the tuples, what Quinn said ...
--> Not able to retrieve the correction that Rik was getting but maybe we leave that?
--> Overview about this reweighting works exactly, Rob's flux is a measurement, doesn't include IMD (Ane≈æka)
