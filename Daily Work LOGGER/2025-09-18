Deep Work #1:
--> Recap on notes from yesterday, do the KEY POINTS todo items from yesterday
--> Flat line problem from yesterday confirmed fixed, changed GENIEXSecExtractor, figuring out how to stash changes and switch 
    to other branch

Deep Work #2:
--> Work on the LE Closure Test:
    --> Figure out if the POT count for the skipped file is causing the problem
        --> I looked into the file and it is a null-ptr, want to change GENIE_xsec_extractor to write the POT to the output
            file so that we can compare it
            --> Is GENIEXSecExtractor even dividing out by the POT? (But then how did the ME closure test pass?)
                ** --> Investigate above

                --> Compare the Genie event rate both w/ and w/o POT normalizing the eff den
                    --> The ratio is around 1 for NOT POT Normalizing the eff den
                    --> For low pT not getting the ratio varying by a lot from 1 anymore ... don't know how that got fixed

                --> Does my xsec extraction script divide out the MC xsec by the MC POT or the data POT?
                    --> The mc cross section is getting normalized by the data POT!!! That's b/c first we made it data POT
                        equivalent and so then divided by the data POT
                    --> IF we divide out by the data POT then the ratio is off by a factor of ~10 (makes sense b/c
                        generated 10x more stats as the data in LE)

                --> What if we don't POT normalize the histograms and divide out by the MC POT?
                    --> Weird thing: we're getting the same thing if we normalize by MC POT or by 1?
                        --> Because I'm modifying simCrossSection histo now and the closure test uses the other mc xsec one!
                        ** Change back the Closure_InputNorm.py !!! for mc histo name
                    --> Ok, to answer the question we get the same result as by data POT equiv and then divide out by data POT

Summary So far: Central issue = POT normalization mismatch in LE closure test (MC POT vs Data POT). 
                GENIEXSecExtractor may be using an LE MC POT off by ~3%. Flux integral bounds = next suspect.

    --> Determine if the flux integral bounds are what are causing the problem

        --> The bounds for the flux integral used are: 0 to 100 GeV

        --> Is the nue constraint turned on or off in the GenieXSecExtractor tool?

    --> Look at Amy's closure test?
    --> 

PICK UP HERE: The stored flux histogram apparently is TH1D m_fluxHist contains flux*NC12*pot
--> We remove the POT Effect NOW? by dividing out [Figure out]
--> LOOSE THREADS: The POT is baked into the flux? 

Deep Work #3
--> Thursday Meeting
--> Area normalize the flux histograms and compare the flux from GENIE w/ the FRW flux
    --> the shape isn't flat ...
    --> for ME though the shape is even more OFF???
    --> 2p2h in xsec spline, should it be there?
    --> Part of the shape is flat though: from 20 to 100, besides the shape problem can integrate for these bounds
        to see if still getting a normalization problem in the closure test



KEY POINTS:
--> Look at the files that I submitted to look at how many electron events are in the LE sample ...
--> Notes from meeting with Deborah
--> For the data bkg subtraction, need to have the electron neutrino flux files ... (can also use wgt of 1? compare and
    see what I get if I use Quinn's existing flux instead --> also look at the systematics on that front)
--> Email Rik about which model predictions to use/include 
--> Change back GENIEXSecExtractor to v6 and ME spline
--> Check what the LE flux is if keep the 2p2h events in the event rate?
--> Revisit notes from Deep Work #3


Questions to Probe
--> Valenic flux and IMD? 
--> Systematic uncertainties coming from the tuples, what Quinn said ...
--> Not able to retrieve the correction that Rik was getting but maybe we leave that?
--> Overview about this reweighting works exactly, Rob's flux is a measurement, doesn't include IMD (Ane≈æka)
