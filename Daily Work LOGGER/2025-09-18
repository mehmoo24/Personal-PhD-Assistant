Deep Work #1:
--> Recap on notes from yesterday, do the KEY POINTS todo items from yesterday
--> Flat line problem from yesterday confirmed fixed, changed GENIEXSecExtractor, figuring out how to stash changes and switch 
    to other branch


Questions to Probe
--> Valenic flux and IMD? 
--> Systematic uncertainties coming from the tuples, what Quinn said ...
--> Not able to retrieve the correction that Rik was getting but maybe we leave that?
--> Overview about this reweighting works exactly, Rob's flux is a measurement, doesn't include IMD
