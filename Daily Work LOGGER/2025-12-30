Today: 
--> archiving
--> Skeleton for the required plots
--> made the iteration dependence plot for all the ptpz bins on x axis, added in sample
gray area for the OF/UF bins
--> Todo: check that the mapping of the binning is correct and shade in all the gray areas for 
the OF/UF bins

Skeleton for slides:
1. MC Reco Ratio (univ/CV) 
2. MC Unfolded Ratio (univ/CV)
3. Iteration Dependence: two sets of plots
4. Data: Systematics breakdown: before/after
5. Data: Total Fractional uncertainty: before/after

Work todo tomorrow:
--> continue: Run validation checks on the one-sided shift and produce the required comparison plots.
--> submit to the grid the antinu LE with all the error bands and muon curvature sig cut being applied to all events
--> process the plots for the p7 tuples that I ran over
--> check up on archiving that I already submitted: gpvm02
