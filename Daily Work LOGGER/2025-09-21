Deep Work Block #1:
--> Closure Test: Go and see if putting back in the 2p2h events fixed the closure problem, take a look at the POT again
--> m_fluxHist: flux * NC12 * pot (For the flux we have the nue constraint turned ON)
    --> Flux integrated xsec, say in Q^2, is N(Q^2) / [ numTargets * pot * fluxIntegral * binWidth ]
    --> "We just need to scale by the ratio of the numTargets to the num of C12, the flux histogram integral & 
         the bin width"
--> Create summary table of LE Closure Test Finds so far


KEY POINT: GenieXSecExtractor running w/ 2p2h events put back in, version changed to v5, and the genie xsec spline
           changed
