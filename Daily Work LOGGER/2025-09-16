Deep Work Session #1: Work on Reweighting Model Predictions using lownu flux parameterizatin
--> Retrieve the ratio of Rob's Flux to Zazueta Flux (w/ IMD)
    --> /exp/minerva/app/users/mmehmood/MAT_AL9/GitRepo-Analysis/ana/FLUXES
    --> 02. Model Comparisons on Local Computer

Deep Work Session #2: Worked on recapping what's going on with the LE Closure Test
--> 2.2 - 3.5% discrepant at the moment
--> The number of targets is tied into the flux and so what I did is I extracted my own LE xsec
    and then for the genie prediction, we used diff normalizations, corresponding to different  
    number of targets used in the flux 
**   --> Need to double check how we get consistency w/ dividing out by same # of targets ...works for ME
--> Running prediction of genie xsec while removing the electron neutrinos
--> Checked that we are getting the same answer for LE xsec w/ muon curvature sig cut on and off 
    (yes MINOS match)

Deep Work Session #3: Figure out how to submit jobs to grid w/ Quinn's prediction of the LE flux
