Deep Work Session #1: Work on Reweighting Model Predictions using lownu flux parameterizatin
** --> Tried to retrieve the ratio of Rob's Flux to Zazueta Flux (w/ IMD)
    --> /exp/minerva/app/users/mmehmood/MAT_AL9/GitRepo-Analysis/ana/FLUXES
    --> 02. Model Comparisons on Local Computer

Deep Work Session #2: Worked on recapping what's going on with the LE Closure Test
--> 2.2 - 3.5% discrepant at the moment
--> The number of targets is tied into the flux and so what I did is I extracted my own LE xsec
    and then for the genie prediction, we used diff normalizations, corresponding to different  
    number of targets used in the flux 
**   --> Need to double check how we get consistency w/ dividing out by same # of targets 
         ...works for ME
--> Running prediction of genie xsec while removing the electron neutrinos
--> Checked that we are getting the same answer for LE xsec w/ muon curvature sig cut on and off 
    (yes MINOS match)
--> 04. Closure Test on Local Computer

Deep Work Session #3: Ran some tests
--> running genie prediction w/ signal defn excluding electron events
** --> running genie prediction w/ signal defn excluding electron events and using correct LE xsec spline
--> checking that the GENIEXSec extractor tool only using 14 and -14 flux files, also appears to be like this in ME
    --> Wondering what the electron neutrinos are doing then ... 
--> submitted jobs to the grid for the case of determining just how many electron neutrino events we even have in LE?
    --> The number of electron neutrinos appears to stay the same regardless of if put in 5 sigma curvature cut or not for 1 run
        (curvature cut not being applied to range)

TODO:  Figure out how to submit jobs to grid w/ Quinn's prediction of the LE flux
