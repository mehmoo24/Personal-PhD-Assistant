	1.	I worked on: ______
	2.	Anchor I advanced today: ______
	3.	Tomorrow Iâ€™ll start with: ______
	4.	One sentence about today: ______

 Deep work sessions: 2 hours, 10 mins maybe
 
 I worked on making the plots for range and curvature and thought about them to look at 2 other things, 
 I generated a framework for easy generation of model predictions from the flattrees
 The lownu flux parameterization should be easily run when added to this
 The script is currently running 18 flattree model predictions right now

 The anchor I advanced today was trying to run over the lownu flux parameterization for the model predictions

 Tomorrow I will start with implementing the lownu flux parameterization for the model predictions
 Run the 12 predictions (not LE) at the end of the work session tomorrow so that it runs overnight

 I feel relaxed

 I have a meeting with Deborah now.
 There are 2 meetings tomorrow: Thursday analysis meeting at 10:30am, York Neutrino Group Meeting at 1:30pm

 4:30-6:30 Deep Work Block 1
 8-10 Deep Work Block 2
 10:30 - 11:30 Analysis Meeting
 12 - 1pm Deep Work Block 3
