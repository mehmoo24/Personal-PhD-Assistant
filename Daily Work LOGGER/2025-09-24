Deep Work #1
LE Closure Test Findings
--> Putting back in the 2p2h events in GENIEXSecExtractor to be divided out by xsec spline seems to have 
    changed nothing
--> Turning off muon correlations in cross section extraction script changes nothing for LE Closure
--> Turning off nue constraint in just the cross section extraction script messes it all up
--> Went through previous notes and saw that if we have nue turned on in all 3 places, or nue turned off in all 
    three places (event selection, xsec extraction, GENIEExtractor) we get the same 3% difference
--> Running w/ the minerva7 gave an enum error
--> Going to look into it being a POT problem again?
