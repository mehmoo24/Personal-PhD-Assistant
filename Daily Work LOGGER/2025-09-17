Deep Work #1: Skipped

Deep Work #2: Probing Discrepancy on Efficiency Ratio Plot
--> the script that I created today for some strange reason says that the ratio is 1, even though comparing
    it interactively to what's in the cross section extraction script it checks out
*    --> but using the script I wrote today gives the difference to be a flat line --> there's something strange going on

KEY POINTS: Figure out why the /exp/minerva/app/users/mmehmood/MAT_AL9/GitRepo-Analysis/ana/SimpleComparison.py is giving
            a flat ratio at 1 for the efficiency, even though when plot it out interactively that isn't how it is

Deep Work #3: Resume the LE Closure Test Work
--> Summarized what the landscape looks like currently for LE Closure Testing by tying together all the loose ends
    and where we stand currently:
    --> The GENIE event rate and my efficiency denominator are consistent with each other
    --> Changing the signal defn to exclude electron neutrino events causes the genie xsec prediction to stay the same?
    --> The Medium Energy xsec spline is only changing the xsec prediction by 0.3%
--> Found the fix to the bug from earlier!


KEY POINTS: Please change back the changes in GENIEXSecExtractor to be v6 and change back the xsec spline. Then go over
            to the other branch and double check that the xsec spline is ME since I think I have v6 on that branch, 
            take a look! 
            Check-in w/ David about the MC comparisons, fix implemented for the bug today that was giving a flat line
            Check Slack for the answer to the question about the flux used for the model predictions
            Visit Notes from Meeting w/ Deborah today
            Look at the files that I submitted to look at how many electron events are in the LE sample ...
