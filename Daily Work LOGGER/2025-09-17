Deep Work #1: Skipped

Deep Work #2: Probing Discrepancy on Efficiency Ratio Plot
--> the script that I created today for some strange reason says that the ratio is 1, even though comparing
    it interactively to what's in the cross section extraction script it checks out
*    --> but using the script I wrote today gives the difference to be a flat line --> there's something strange going on
