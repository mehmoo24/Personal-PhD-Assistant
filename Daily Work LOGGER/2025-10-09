NUISANCE Tutorial: https://github.com/NUISANCEMC/tutorials/blob/main/interactive/README.md

Deep Work #1: 11am - 1pm

--> Determine if the MINERvA LE flux file in NUISANCE tutorial really isn't the same as what is in FRW

--> Commands to be able to run the container: 
export PATH=/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/mis/singularity/bin:$PATH
export SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=/exp/minerva/app/users/mmehmood/MAT_AL9/GitRepo-Analysis/ana/nuisance_tutorials/interactive/

Todo: Check the impact that scaling the flux prediction has on the cross section prediction ...
also, using the LE Nuisance Tutorial flux yields quite the difference in the cross section ...

Currently, ran all model predictions with the FRW flux (per GeV and per POT)

Pick up: Do the mechanical work to submit all the model comparions, a total of 12, 6 for neutrino mode and 6 for antineutrino
