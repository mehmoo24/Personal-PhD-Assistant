Goal: Publish the extracted cross section for neutrinos and antineutrinos in LE and ME Beams
--> The LE Closure Test

--> Get understanding of systematics breakdown and the size of each one
--> Covariance Matrices
--> Warping Study + Additional Stat. Uncertainty Study
--> Model Comparisons have for all of them except antinu LE
--> GiBUU Model Predictions
--> Fascinating comparisons of the ME and LE fluxes and the level of contamination in each beam
--> The background breakdown plots for the two modes as a result of that

--> Finalize the binning using the migration matrices
--> Get to the bottom of the muon curvature significance cut that gets used
--> p4 production versus the p6 production
