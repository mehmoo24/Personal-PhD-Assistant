Work Today:
--> Started making the plot for the total error, but see that the total uncertainty before
and after implementing the one sided shift is the same, emailed prof to ask about that, will 
continue looking into it tomorrow

Parking Lot:
--> continue: Run validation checks on the one-sided shift and produce the required comparison plots.
--> submit to the grid the antinu LE with all the error bands and muon curvature sig cut being applied to all events
--> process the plots for the p7 tuples that I ran over
--> check up on archiving that I already submitted: gpvm02
