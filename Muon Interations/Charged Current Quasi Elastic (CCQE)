CCQE Mode is defined as pre-FSI

So even if you're doing a truth level study with CCQE, you could still knock out a neutron that could create pions and so you
have pions in the final state

--> The GENIE Mod? cut cuts on the truth interaction but the final state particles could also include pions because those 
    are post FSI

****************
Kinetic Energy:
****************

--> For higher energies, most of the energy is going entirely to the muon and not to the proton or the neutron, the 
    kinetic energy distributions for protons and neutrons there are nearly going flat near 0
