Important Learning Points

--> IF a lot of the pacman tiles are above threshold, that makes sense if they're doing a purity monitor run, and should
    come down once the run is over

--> AmBe source: It’s a low energy neutron source. It’s an abbreviation for “Americium Beryllium”, where Am241 is an alpha 
                 emitter and when Be9 absorbs the alpha it creates an excited carbon state which releases a neutron and 
                 a gamma in coincidence when it decays.

--> When ramp down the high voltage, have seen effects on the charge readout as as result of that too, (like seeing
    alternating green and gray on the plot for the ADC mean and RMS by tile)

--> The timestanp isn't updating for the active and dead channels: THE PLOTS DON'T UPDATE WHEN WE'RE NOT TAKING A RUN
    --> Shouldn't assume a new run was automatically started when the current run was stopped
