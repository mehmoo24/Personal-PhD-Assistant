Instructions for the shift: https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/argoncube-2x2-demonstrator/wiki/Ac2x2-shift-how-to_

1. Message the previous shifter to let them know that you're here
2. Fill out the check-in once at start, the check-out once at end, the other 2 forms every hour
3. The NoVNC has all the tabs already open that we need to be monitoring
4. For something specific that's wrong, message the expert on call and ask about it, like the pixel maps

* Don't need to put subject entry, but good to do that
* No voltage in the SiPMs if the HV is turned off
* For non critical alarm, put yes if in the same time window
* LRS DAQ stops recording data when they're testing it, CRO still collects data when they're testing it, but plots may
  look off for both cases
* Vibrations may look not stable if have peaks, to see how long the problem has been there, can change the time scale
* For pacmans: go one-by-one and check a bunch of things, for irregularity in rectangles should see that no longer rectange
  --> P5, P6 exceptions listed because one tile higher than the rest of the tiles
* Upload the screenshots for the bad chips for each pacman
* Put a separate entry in ECL as well if something significant is off on top of filling it out in the form
